# Redux Books List Simple Web Application 

### Summary

In this redux centered simple web application, I've settled the most fundamental bases on how a client side react application works hooked to the Redux library for state management. 

That includes Actions, Reducers, and Containers. 

Redux is characterized by centralizing all the application's state into a single plain javascript object. 

This exercise is been useful to identify the critical connection points that enable a component to be aware of the application state (mapStateToProps), and to allow for this state to be changed in response only to dispatched actions (mapDispatchToProps).

A 360ยบ overview of the redux cycle is been achieved through the completion of this exercise.
